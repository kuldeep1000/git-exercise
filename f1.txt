So Formula 1 is a very popular racing event held all over the globe. 
Getting to organise this event is a prestige for the country.
Players who want to compete in the frontier of auto racing industry are super agile and quick to react to the situations. 
They start preparing when they are like 6-7 years old. 
It is expensive of course. 
Both in terms of money and persistence.
