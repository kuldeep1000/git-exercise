On my keyboard, the f2 key when pressed does something.
I do not know what it does. 
I have a laptop keyboard.
So when I press fn key and then press f2 key, then it reduces the brightness of the screen. 
Interesting. I think pressing F2 normally would jump you to edit either the name of the file or the things that are written in address bar, for ex.
